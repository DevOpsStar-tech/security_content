name: Windows WSUS Spawning Shell

author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a shell (PowerShell.exe
  or Cmd.exe) is spawned from wsusservice.exe, the Windows Server Update Services
  process. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process creation events where the parent process is wsusservice.exe.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate exploitation of CVE-2025-59287, a
  critical deserialization vulnerability in WSUS that allows unauthenticated remote
  code execution. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands on WSUS servers, potentially leading to system compromise,
  data exfiltration, domain enumeration, or further lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate WSUS maintenance scripts or administrative tools
  may spawn shells in rare cases. However, wsusservice.exe spawning interactive shells
  is highly abnormal behavior. Review the command line arguments and user context
  to determine legitimacy. Filter known administrative scripts if needed.
