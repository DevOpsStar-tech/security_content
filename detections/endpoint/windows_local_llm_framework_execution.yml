description: |
  The following analytic detects execution of unauthorized local LLM frameworks (Ollama, LM Studio, GPT4All, Jan, llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, Oobabooga, NutStudio) and Python-based AI/ML libraries (HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain) on Windows endpoints by leveraging process creation events.
  It identifies cases where known LLM framework executables are launched or command-line arguments reference AI/ML libraries.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate shadow AI deployments, unauthorized model inference operations, or potential data exfiltration through local AI systems.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, intellectual property theft, or circumvention of organizational AI governance policies.

how_to_implement: |
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate development, data science, and AI/ML workflows where
  authorized developers, researchers, or engineers intentionally execute local LLM
  frameworks (Ollama, LM Studio, GPT4All, Jan, NutStudio) for model experimentation,
  fine-tuning, or prototyping. Python developers using HuggingFace Transformers or
  LangChain for legitimate AI/ML projects. Approved sandbox and lab environments where
  framework testing is authorized. Open-source contributors and hobbyists running
  frameworks for educational purposes. Third-party applications that bundle or invoke
  LLM frameworks as dependencies (e.g., IDE plugins, analytics tools, chatbot integrations).
  System administrators deploying frameworks as part of containerized services or
  orchestrated ML workloads. Process name keyword overlap with unrelated utilities
  (e.g., "llama-backup", "janimation"). Recommended tuning — baseline approved frameworks
  and users by role/department, exclude sanctioned dev/lab systems via the filter
  macro, correlate with user identity and peer group anomalies before escalating to
  incident response.
