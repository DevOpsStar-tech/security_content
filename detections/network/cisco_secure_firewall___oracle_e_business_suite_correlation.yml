description: |
  This correlation rule identifies potential exploitation attempts of Oracle E-Business Suite vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-61882 and CVE-2025-61884) by correlating multiple intrusion signatures from Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs.
  The detection looks for specific signatures that indicate attempts to exploit the TemplatePreview functionality and vulnerable SyncServlet endpoints as well as post compromise activity involving Cl0p.
  By correlating these signatures, the analytic aims to identify coordinated exploitation attempts that may indicate an attacker is targeting Oracle E-Business Suite installations.
  Security teams should investigate any instances of these correlated signatures, especially if they are found in conjunction with other suspicious network activity or on systems that should not be exposed to such threats.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the IntrusionEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The intrusion access policy must also be configured.
known_false_positives: False positives should be very unlikely.
