description: |
  This analytic detects vulnerability exploitation and post-compromise activity associated with Oracle E-Business Suite web-application vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-61882 and CVE-2025-61884.
  SIDs 65413-65415 detect detect Java.Backdoor.Cl0p variant payload downloads and Java.Backdoor.Cl0p outbound
  command-and-control connection attempts.
  SIDs 65456, 65377 and 65378 detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities.
  Security teams should investigate any instances of these signatures, especially if they are found in conjunction with other suspicious network activity or on systems that should not be exposed to such threats.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the IntrusionEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The intrusion access policy must also be configured.
known_false_positives: False positives should be unlikely.
