description: |
  This analytic detects modifications to authentication and authorization (AAA) security policies on Cisco ASA devices via CLI or ASDM.
  AAA policies control critical security mechanisms including authentication attempts, lockout thresholds, password policies, and access control settings that protect administrative access to network infrastructure.
  Adversaries or malicious insiders may weaken authentication policies to facilitate brute force attacks, disable account lockouts to enable unlimited password attempts, reduce password complexity requirements, or modify authorization settings to elevate privileges and maintain persistent access.
  The detection monitors for command execution events containing AAA-related commands such as `aaa authentication`, `aaa authorization`, or `aaa local authentication`, focusing on changes to authentication attempts, lockout policies, and access control configurations.
  Investigate any unauthorized modifications to AAA policies, especially changes that weaken security posture (increasing max-fail attempts, disabling lockouts, reducing password requirements), and verify these changes against approved change management processes and security policies.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco ASA syslog data to be ingested into Splunk via the Cisco Security Cloud TA.
  To ensure this detection works effectively, configure your ASA and FTD devices to generate and forward message ID 111008 and 111010.
  If your logging level is set to 'Notifications' or higher, these messages should already be included, else we recommend setting an event list that keeps the severity level you are using and adds message IDs 111008 and 111010.
  You can find specific instructions on how to set this up here : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/pix-500-series-security-appliances/63884-config-asa-00.html.
  You can also change the severity level of the above message id's to the syslog level you have currently enabled using the logging message syslog_id level severity_level command in global configuration mode. For more information, see Change the Severity Level of a Syslog Message : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa922/configuration/general/asa-922-general-config/monitor-syslog.html#ID-2121-000006da
known_false_positives: |
  Legitimate AAA configuration modifications may occur during normal administrative activities such as implementing new security policies, adjusting lockout thresholds or troubleshooting authentication issues. These events should be verified and investigated. Consider filtering modifications performed by known administrative accounts where necessary.
