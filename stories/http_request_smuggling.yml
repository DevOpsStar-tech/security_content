narrative: HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences
 of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users. This typically abuses how requests are exchanged
 between a client and server, often a proxy or load balancer. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often
 critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to 
 sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.
